# Synchronization
This repository will contain various implementations of different techniques on classical synchronization problems.

# Problems
1) [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Readers%E2%80%93writers_problem](Readers-writers problem)

2) [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Producer%E2%80%93consumer_problem](Producer-consumer problem)

3) [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dining_philosophers_problem](Dining philosophers problem)

# Implementations

Implementation language may vary between Java and Python. Message passing concept should be reusable in any language.

First, I will implement these classical problems using semaphores and monitor.
- Readers-writers problems using semaphores
- Producer-consumer problems using semaphores
- Producer-consumer problems using monitor
- Dining philosophers problems using semaphores

Second, I will implement these classical problems using message passing.
- Readers-writers problems using message passing
- Producer-consumer problems using message passing
- Producer-consumer problems using message passing

Finally, I will implement a semaphore using message passing and then implement classical problems
- Semaphore implementation using message passing

The final goal would be to measure performance.
- Semaphore VS message passing
- Semaphore VS message passing semaphore
- Message passing semaphore VS message passing
